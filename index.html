utf 8 is standard encoding for charset, as uses all international symbols,
 if page language looks screwy it may be encoding using a different method than ut8
 this section must be at the top of <head> so file knows how to interpret it

    <p>I am a keen learner, completing a B.Sc. in Psychology through the Open University
        (for which my final research project was Highly Commended in the <a
                href="https://undergraduateawards.com/winners/highly-commended-2017"> Global Undergraduate Awards</a>)
        alongside working full-time and
        more recently, completing courses in Python and Machine Learning.
        .I enjoy problem-solving and working with data,
        which is a smaller part of my current role and has motivated the shift in career.
        Completing my degree included working with statistical analysis, e.g. hypothesis testing and
        report writing showing both statistical skills and ability to communicate complex ideas in an appropriate manner.

        Communication in my current role is also key, as it requires the understanding of relevant legislation and explaining the
        relevance to various *placeholder word* others including headteachers and other school staff, parents and other agencies.
        I am also frequently required to provide data to schools and senior staff members from spreadsheets I maintain,
        of data related to application information and pupil movement. Need to cut this down and explain how,
        i.e. what i use and what improvements I made
